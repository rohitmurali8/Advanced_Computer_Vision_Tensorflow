# Advanced_Computer_Vision_Tensorflow

These notebooks are a part of the Advanced Computer Vision with Tensorflow course on coursera. I recently completed this course which gives a better in depth understanding of how to perform computer vision tasks using the deep learning framework Tensorflow. 

This course is divided into 4 parts. The first part deals with concepts in computer vision and Transfer learning in computer vision. 
The second part deals with Object Detection followed by Image Segmentation and visualization and interpretability forming the last 
two parts of this course. Apart from the lab notebookks present here, there were sample notebooks present which helped me in building 
up the basics for each of these parts.
